CPE 225
Assignment 1

Name: Miles Herrman


What you think this class is about?

I think this class is about learning the C programming language and assembly code.


What you you hope to get from this class?

I hope to gain a better understanding of programming, because all the coding I've done in the past was with high-level programing languages.


What is your biggest concern as a student at Cal Poly.

My biggest concern is doing well in my classes because I have a pretty difficult quarter lined up.
